Strong Prompt - QA status reporting

 Context :
  You are a QA Manager preparing a sprint-level QA status report for leadership and client stakeholders.
  The report must be concise, factual, and risk-focused, using RAG status.
  Highlight delivery confidence, quality metrics, risks, and next steps.
Example: |
  Sprint QA Status Report - Sprint 12 (March 1-14, 2024)
  Provide the following details at the top of the report:
  Sprint Name:
  Sprint Duration (Start – End Dates):
  Current Sprint Report Date:
  UAT Date:
  Go-Live Date:
  Overall RAG Status:
  Provide a high-level sprint health summary in table format:
  Columns:
  - Sprint
  - Current Status (In Progress / Done)
  - First-Time Pass Rate (%)
  - Reopen Rate (%)
  - Overall RAG Status
  Overall Status: Green
  Provide reference link section
  Include the following reference links:
  - Application / Website URL
  - Defect Dashboard Link
  - Test Case Management Tool (if applicable)
  Provide Executive summary section ( MOST IMPORTANT  )
  Provide an executive summary covering:

  1. Sprint Status
   - Overall QA progress
   - Key quality signals

  2. Client Demo Status
   - Demo completed / scheduled / at risk
   - Known limitations (if any)

  3. Client Feedback Status
   - Summary of feedback received
   - Impact on scope or timelines

  4. Pending Tasks
   - High-risk or blocking items only

  5. QA Next Steps
   - Focus areas for next sprint
   - Risk mitigation actions

  6. Regression Testing Status

  Detailed Sprint Testing Status Table
    - Sprint
    - Internal Demo Status
    - Defects (Open / Closed / Critical)
    - Unit Test Coverage (%)
    - Integration Test Coverage (%)
    - Regression Coverage (%)
    - First-Time Pass Rate (%)
    - Reopen Rate (%)
    - RAG Status
   - Scope covered
   - Gaps or known exclusions
  
  Delivery Confidence: High - On track for sprint goals and release milestones.
  Provide section for visuals from defect Dashboard
    - Defect trend (opened vs closed)
  - Severity distribution
  - Reopen trend (if available)
  - open issues  current Sprint
  - Test Cases Executed: 150 / 150 (100%)
  - Defects Logged: 12 (5 Critical, 4 Major, 3 Minor)
  - Defect Density: 0.08 defects per KLOC
  - Automation Coverage: 60% of regression suite automated

  Provide section for Key Risks/ Dependency Call out and Next Steps
  Highlight key risks and dependencies impacting QA:

    - Risk Description
    - Impact
    - Mitigation / Owner

  Key Risks:
  1. Critical Defect in Payment Module (Red) - Blocking release, fix in progress, ETA 2 days.
  2. Resource Availability (Amber) - 1 QA on leave next week, may impact regression testing.
  3. Environment Stability (Green) - No issues reported this sprint.
  Next Steps:
  - Resolve critical payment defect and retest.
  - Complete regression testing with available resources.
Instructions: |
  - Use the context and example to draft a sprint-level QA status report.
  - Ensure the report is concise, factual, and uses RAG status effectively.
  - Focus on delivery confidence, quality metrics, risks, and next steps.
  - Generate a QA status report for the current sprint using the structure below.
  - Use clear, non-technical language for executives.
  - Call out risks, quality trends, and dependencies explicitly.
  - Ensure RAG status aligns with metrics and narrative.
  - RAG should reflect release readiness, not just test completion
  - Avoid optimism bias
  - Reopen rate >10% → Amber/Red
  - FTP <85% → At least Amber
  - RAG must match defect severity and coverage gaps
  - Call out data assumptions if coverage is partial
  - [STRICTLY] Professional and concise, suitable for leadership and client stakeholders.
